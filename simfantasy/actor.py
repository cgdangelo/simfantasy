    Warnings:
        Although level is accepted as an argument, many of the formulae only work at level 70. This argument may be
        deprecated in the future, or at least restricted to max levels of each game version, i.e., 50, 60, 70 for
        A Realm Reborn, Heavensward, and Stormblood respectively, where it's more likely that someone spent the time to
        figure out all the math.

    Arguments:
        sim (simfantasy.simulator.Simulation): Pointer to the simulation that the actor is participating in.
        race (simfantasy.enum.Race): Race and clan of the actor.

        target (Optional[simfantasy.actor.Actor]): The enemy that the actor is targeting.
        name (Optional[str]): Name of the actor.
        gear (Optional[Dict[~simfantasy.enums.Slot, Union[~simfantasy.simulator.Item, ~simfantasy.simulator.Weapon]]]):
            Collection of equipment that the actor is wearing.

    Attributes:
        _target_data (Dict[~simfantasy.actor.Actor, ~simfantasy.actor.TargetData): Mapping of actors to any
            available target state data.
        animation_unlock_at (datetime.datetime): Timestamp when the actor will be able to execute actions again without
            being inhibited by animation lockout.
        auras (List[simfantasy.aura.Aura]): Auras, both friendly and hostile, that exist on the actor.
        gcd_unlock_at (datetime.datetime): Timestamp when the actor will be able to execute GCD actions again without
            being inhibited by GCD lockout.
        gear (Dict[~simfantasy.enums.Slot, Union[~simfantasy.simulator.Item, ~simfantasy.simulator.Weapon]]):
            Collection of equipment that the actor is wearing.
